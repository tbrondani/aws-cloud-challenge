# Task 4

Access the instance(by hand) and install apache, modify the default apache page to say "I did it".



# Solution 

I've created and .alternative, in case you want to see a more organized way of using a external script instead of putting the EOF in the middle of the code(makes it hard to maitain if you use it)
